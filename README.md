**Office Building Floor Plan**

This is a hybrid mobile app developed with Ionic that displays a mini map of each floor of an office building. Our team developed
this app under less than 24 hours in a hackathon event. This app is now able to display mock floor plans. In the floor plan page
for each level, users can search for a specific room by name in the search bar. Once users click on a room in the page, the
corresponding room location will be highlighted in the floor plan and available facility information of that room will be 
shown in the drop-down. We have been planning to extend and carry on developing new features for this app including real-time 
GPS tracking and location to navigate users in the map.
